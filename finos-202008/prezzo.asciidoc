== Background
[%step]
* Waltz: an Enterprise Information System
* Approx. 6 yrs old (started as pure OSS)
* 3-4 devs + 1 analyst
* Transitioned to FINOS earlier this year
* Gaining users in other financial institutions and other industries

[background-color="#030a08"]
== Overview
_An open approach to enterprise architecture_

[%step]
* Widespread frustration with centralised architecture
** Incomplete, disjoint, adhoc datasets 
* Waltz embraces a collaborative, many-eyes model 
* Promote standardisation
* Perhaps allow cross bank standards


[background-color="#030a08"]
=== Approach
[%step]
* Help large orgs to understand their technical landscape
* What things are, what they do, how they connect, who works on them and how they are changing
* Widely used by diverse set of users



[background-color="#222"]
== Ease of adoption

[%step]
* Deutsche Bank has > 15,000 active users
* >2,500 user driven changes per month


[background-color="#222"]
== Benefits

[%step]
* Flows & Lineage
** Regulatory / Audit aid
* SDLC Controls
** Release controls for arch health
* App Rationalisation
** Alignment to enterprise taxonomies


[background-color="#222"]
== Benefits (cont)

[%step]
* Surveys, supporting:
** Records Management
** Legal Holds
** ARchitecture Governance
** Cloud Migration
* Documenting Roadmaps




== Open Source
Open Source & the Enterprise


=== Fundamentals 
* If you want people to adopt, shift to open dev
[%step]
** _Use_ accessible issue trackers
** Don't want your project commit log to be  'just a bunch of stuff that happened'
** Isolate any non OSS components (e.g. databases)


=== Challenges
[%step]
* Realistic sample data difficult to produce
* Need to be v. careful with commits 
** Extra review step for data leakage concerns
* IP concerns extend to design docs and issue descriptions


=== Challenges (cont.)
[%step]
* Project pressures
[%step]
** Long term roadmap vs short term tactical needs of funding company
** Stakeholders not always sympathetic to doing the 'right thing' for everyone
* Lack of commercial support
** Barrier to adoption by smaller orgs


=== Leverage the OSS Ecosystem
[%step]
* Abundance of very good project support:
** Building, Testing
** Quality, Security
* Usually extremely easy to onboard and use
* FINOS offer support and guidance

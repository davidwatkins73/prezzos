* Part 1: Waltz overview
* Part 2: Open Source challenges / rewards



[background-color="#050712"]
== Background
[%step]
* Waltz: an Enterprise Information System
* Approx. 6 yrs old (started as pure OSS)
* 3-4 devs + 1 analyst
* Transitioned to FINOS earlier this year
* Several thousand users in DB
* Gaining users in other financial institutions and other industries

[.notes]
--
* Inspired by a tool developed in RBC which proved the concept/gap
* Currently _Incubating_ in FINOS, undergoing _Activation_
* 5K apps registered
* Tens of thousands of flows

[background-color="#030a08"]
== Overview
[%step]
* Help large orgs to understand their technical landscape
* What things are, what they do, how they connect, who works on them and how they are changing
* Widely used by diverse set of users

[.notes]
--
* historically current state focus
* future state flows, app functions, change impact
* PM's, analysts, devs, execs

--


[background-color="#030a08"]
=== Approach
_An open approach to enterprise architecture_

[%step]
* Widespread frustration with centralised architecture
** Incomplete, disjoint, adhoc datasets 
* Waltz embraces a collaborative model 
* Promote standardisation
* Perhaps allow cross bank standards


[background-color="#222"]
== Uses

[%step]
* App rationalisation, function decomms, migrations, roadmaps
* Data architecture: lineage (BCBS), auth sources
* (Regulatory) Compliance
** GDPR, Records Management, Legal Holds
* SDLC & KPI's / KRI's
** Platform adoption, standard adherence

[.notes]
--
* Auth sources / Right-Sourcing
* Regulators wanting evidence understanding our _entire_ estate
* SDLC - Waltz part of the go/no-go prod checks (no flows?, no bookmarks?, no attestations?)
* Core platform simplification / reducing complexity, enabled by common taxonomies
--



[background-color="#222"]
=== Model
[%step]
* Strict data model
[%step]
** Applications, Taxonomies, Data flows & Data types
** Organisational Units, People, Change Initiatives & Roadmaps
** Servers, Databases, Software & Licenses
* Opinionated model allows us to do more 'out of the box'

[.notes]
--
* Strong data models ease reporting & coding
* Perils of 'define your own data model'
* Software & Licenses : OSS , license risk etc
--


[background-color="#222"]
=== Customisation
[%step]
* _...but_ we do have some extension capabilities
[%step]
** Assessments
** Metrics
** Surveys
** Notes


[background-color="#222"]
=== Grouping
* Dynamic aggregation based on traits
* Ad hoc group creation
* Automated groups

Drawing flow diagrams

[.notes]

* builds upon point to point flows
* end up with a diagram 'BOM' so can be x-referenced

== Open Source
Open Source & the Enterprise

IMPORTANT: _Observations are mine, **not** those of my client_


=== Basics 
* If you want people to adopt, shift to open dev
[%step]
** _Use_ accessible issue trackers
** Don't want your project commit log to be  'just a bunch of stuff that happened'
** Isolate any non OSS components (e.g. databases)


=== Challenges
[%step]
* Realistic sample data difficult to produce
* Need to be v. careful with commits 
** Extra review step for data leakage concerns
* IP concerns extend to design docs and issue descriptions


=== Challenges (cont.)
[%step]
* Project pressures
[%step]
** Long term roadmap vs short term tactical needs of funding company
** Stakeholders not always sympathetic to doing the 'right thing' for everyone
* Lack of commercial support
** Barrier to adoption by smaller orgs


=== Leverage the OSS Ecosystem
[%step]
* Abundance of very good project support:
** Building, Testing
** Quality, Security
* Usually extremely easy to onboard and use
* FINOS offer support and guidance

[.notes]
--
* some of these concerns alleviated by increased user base
* distirbuted dev
** from single dev, to team, to multiple locs, to multiple companies, to everyone wfh!

= Waltz Brownbag

==  Background 

* Inspired by a tool developed in RBC which proved the concept/gap
* Currently _Incubating_ in FINOS, undergoing _Activation_
* 5K apps registered
* Tens of thousands of flows
* Interest from public transport, automobile industries and smaller financial institutions


== Overview

* Dissatisfied with current tools
* Data may be controlled but was
** out of date
** incomplete
** not cross referenced
** scattered across stale sharepoints / excel / access etc
* Wanted to drive adoption of common standards and taxonomies
* cross referencing exposes gaps and opportunities to combine data in new ways 


== Approach

* Capture information in consistend format
* Narrowing the problem space
* historically current state focused, increasingly being used to map target state
* Users include developers, analysts, project managers, executives


== Uses

* Auth sources / Right-Sourcing
* Regulators wanting evidence understanding our _entire_ estate
* SDLC - Waltz part of the go/no-go prod checks (no flows?, no bookmarks?, no attestations?)
* Core platform simplification / reducing complexity, enabled by common taxonomies


== Model 
* Strong data models ease reporting & coding
* Perils of 'define your own data model'
* Software & Licenses : OSS , license risk etc


== Customisation
* Flexibility in the model is offered by specific extension entities


== Grouping
* Pivot the data using taxonomies


== Screenshots

* note the decomm info
* Flow fiagram 
** builds upon point to point flows
** end up with a diagram 'BOM' so can be x-referenced and becomes 'just another group'
